./sRead 1000 -> 0m10.996s
./sRead 100  -> 0m1.104s
./sRead 10   -> 0m0.113s

Observation: with more reads, the program takes longer to run.

Explanation: It is due to the fact that the cpu is just waiting for one read to finish until moving onto the next one
And since disk reads are relatively slow, calls to sRead with larger numbers take longer to finish.
