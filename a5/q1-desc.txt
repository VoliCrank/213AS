Loading:
1. load value of i
2. load value of a (which is an address)
3. load a* (load the value from the address stored in a)
4. load a->x[i]
5. load a->b.a
6. load a->b.y[i]
7  load address of a->b.a
8. load a->b.a->x[i]

Write:
Storing the values into v0,v1,v2,v3 and a->b.a = a's address. So, 5 times in total.
