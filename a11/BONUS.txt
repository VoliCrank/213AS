I submitted different versions of well and well_sem. Well.c attempts to account for fairness while well_sem simply switches when the well empty. Comparing with my earlier version of well where fairness was not accounted, I noticed that there is nobody who waits for an exceptionally long time in well_sem whereas 1 or 2 people might wait for 1000+ times in well. This can be attributed to the fact that some threads might cut the line in the while loop in enterWell in well.c. Threads cannot cut the line in well_sem because there is no loop of any kind and once they reach wait, they are added to the end of the waiting queue kept in the semaphore.
